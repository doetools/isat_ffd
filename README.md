# `isat_ffd`
`isat_ffd`  is a reduced order model trained by FFD simulations that can be used for fast predictions of airflow in the building. For the detailed performance evaluation of `isat_ffd`, one should refer to the [journal paper](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs/sites/default/files/attached-files/2018_wtian_isat_1.pdf).

`ffd`, which is the abbreviation of Fast Fluid Dynamics, is parallelized in OpenCL to run full-scale simulations on multi-core devices, and generates training data for the reduced order model `isat`. 

`isat` was originally developed by Professor Stephen B. Pope at the Cornell University to efficiently simulate the racting flow with detailed chemistry. For more information regarding `isat`, one can go to the [webpage](https://tcg.mae.cornell.edu/isat.html)
